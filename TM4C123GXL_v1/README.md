# TM4C123GXL 4-Layer PCB Design

This repository contains the final project for the **Professional PCB Designer with Altium Designer** course completed under the guidance of Eng. Ahmed Aboul Fotouh.

## Project Overview

As part of the course, I designed a 4-layer PCB for the TM4C123GXL microcontroller, showcasing advanced schematic design, component integration, and PCB layout skills.

## TM4C123GXL Microcontroller

The TM4C123GXL is a versatile microcontroller from Texas Instruments' Tiva C series, featuring:
- ARM Cortex-M4F processor
- Extensive peripherals including GPIO, ADC, UART, I2C, and PWM
- 256KB of Flash memory and 32KB of SRAM
- On-chip debugging capabilities
